# Building a Restaurant Menu

**Objective: Design a menu for a restaurant.**
- Instructions:

    Create an HTML file named menu.html.
    Use <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize the page.
    Create a <section> for each type of dish (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts) with appropriate headings (<h2>) and a list of menu items.
    Each menu item should be listed using <ul> or <ol> and include <h3> for the dish name and a <p> for the description and price.
    Include a <footer> with the restaurantâ€™s address and contact information.

**Outcome: Your page will display a structured menu with different sections for various types of dishes.**
